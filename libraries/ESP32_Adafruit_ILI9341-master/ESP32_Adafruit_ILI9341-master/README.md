# Demos for ILI9341-based TFT displays using the Espressif ESP32

See end of this file for credits and code provenance

This project uses a combination of [Adafruit's Arduino ILI9341 driver](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9341) and [their Arduino display graphics library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library) (with a few extra fonts added from [DSEG](https://github.com/keshikan/DSEG) and processed via [http://oleddisplay.squix.ch/](http://oleddisplay.squix.ch/)).

The original Arduino libraries above work for those using [the Arduino-ESP32 project](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32), with some pin modifications for your particular setup (e.g., the ESP-WROVER-KIT, which also controls the backlight on GPIO_5). The ILI9341 driver in particular is ESP32-aware now.

While there are no plans to convert the native SDK-based demos below to Arduino-ESP32 code, Arduino-specific demos are included here now.

## Demo code (tested using the ESP-WROVER-KIT)

  - demos/arduino-esp32
      - Install Arduino-ESP32
      - Add the current Adafruit_ILI9341 and Adafruit_GFX_Library
      - Build and flash via the Arduino IDE

  - demos/esp-idf  *(CURRENTLY DEFUNCT)*
      - Install [Espressif's esp-idf SDK and toolchain](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)
      - Build and flash using the usual SDK methods (`make`; `make flash`; etc.).

## About the SDK-based sample code:

### THIS SECTION AND ITS CODE ARE CURRENTLY DEFUNCT

The sample code consists of two parts:
  - ~~Rotating cube https://youtu.be/kEWThKicO0Q~~
  - Sample HVAC controller UI using the ESP-WROVER-KIT (for the extended version of this: http://habrahabr.ru/post/214257/) https://youtu.be/VraLl8XK1CI

The driver itself and needed dependencies are in /driver and /include/driver.

The driver is written in C++ which is not well supported by ESP8266 toolchain and sdk, so some dirty hack is needed to properly contstruct C++ objects. The code for this is in user/routines.cpp.

In spite of the fact that according to the datasheet max ILI9341's clock speed is 10MHz mine robustly works at up to 40MHz so I added SPI speed prescaler macro at the beginning of hspi.c.
Defining it to 1 means HSPI will be clocked at 40MHz, 4 means 10 MHz.

What to demonstrate is controlled by macro UIDEMO defined at the beginning of user_main.cpp. If it's defined then the sample HVAC controller UI is shown, else, the rotating cube is rendered.

## Wiring (see code for the ESP-WROVER-KIT default values)
The code uses hardware HSPI with hardware controlled CS, so the wiring shall be as follows: 

    ILI9341 pin --> ESP32 GPIO pin of choice
    MOSI        --> GPIO13
    MISO        --> n/c
    CLK         --> GPIO14
    CS          --> GPIO15
    DC          --> GPIO2
    Reset       --> pull up to 3.3V
    GND         --> ground

## Credits
Basis 1: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9341
    This is a library for the Adafruit ILI9341 display products
    
    This library works with the Adafruit 2.8" Touch Shield V2 (SPI)
      ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/1651
     
    Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
    These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required
    to interface (RST is optional).

Basis 2: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
    This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a
    common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).
    It needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library for each display
    device we carry (to handle the lower-level functions).
